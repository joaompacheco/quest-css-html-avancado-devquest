## Overview

This project is a challenge from Front End mentor that is also a QUEST from the DEVQUEST course that I am doing. The challenge can be found on this link: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-a-single-introductory-section-B_2Wvxgi0. The objective is built the page more close as possible to the design supplied, using any concept you want to.

## My process

To build this page I resorted to the concepts that I have already consolidated CSS and attended some classes of the online course I am doing at the moment called "DEVQUEST". The course has helped me a lot to understand concepts that was with many doubts such as: flex display and display grid. Researching MDN documentation has helped me a lot to understand the workings of the elements in CSS.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Display Flex
- Display Grid

### Continued development

My objetive is continue building more and more projects with new concepts and technologies.
